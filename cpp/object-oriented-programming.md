# Object-Oriented Programming

## Classes and Objects

A C++ class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates information and behavior about an object.

A class can have two types of class members:

   * Attributes, also known as member data, consist of information about an instance of the class.
   * Methods, also known as member functions, are functions that can be used with an instance of the class.

An object is an instance of a class and can be created by specifying the class name.
```
#include <iostream>

class Dog {
public:
  int age;
  
  void sound() {
    std::cout << "woof\n";
  }
};

int main() {
  Dog buddy;
  
  buddy.age = 5;
  
  buddy.sound();	// Outputs: woof
}
```
## Access Specifiers

Access specifiers are C++ keywords that determine the scope of class components:

   * public: Class members are accessible from anywhere in the program.
   * private: Class members are only accessible from inside the class.

Encapsulation is achieved by declaring class attributes as private:

   * Accessor functions: return the value of private member variables.
   * Mutator functions: change the value of private member variables.
```
#include <iostream>

class Computer {
private:
  int password;
  
public:
  int getPassword() {
    return password;
  }

  void setPassword(int new_password) {
    password = new_password;
  }
};

int main()
{
  Computer dell;

  dell.setPassword(12345);
  std::cout << dell.getPassword();

  return 0;
}
```
## Constructors

For a C++ class, a constructor is a special kind of method that enables control regarding how the objects of a class should be created. Different class constructors can be specified for the same class, but each constructor signature must be unique.

A constructor can have multiple parameters as well as default parameter values.

In order to initialize const or reference type attributes, use member initializer lists instead of normal constructors.
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class House {
private:
  std::string location;
  int rooms;

public:
  // Constructor with default parameters
  House(std::string loc = "New York", int num = 5) {
    location = loc;
    rooms = num;
  }
  
  // Destructor
  ~House() {
    std::cout << "Moved away from " << location << "\n";
  }
};

int main()
{
  House default_house;	// Calls House("New York", 5)
  House texas_house("Texas");	// Calls House("Texas", 5)
  House big_florida_house("Florida", 10);	// Calls House("Florida", 10)
  
  return 0;
}
```
## Inheritance

In C++, a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. In an inheritance relationship, there are two categories of classes:

   * Base class: The class being inherited from.
   * Derived class: The class that inherits from the base class.

It???s possible to have multi-level inheritance where classes are constructed in order from the ???most base??? class to the ???most derived??? class.
```
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
  int base_id;

  Base(int new_base) : base_id(new_base) {}
};

class Derived: public Base {
public:
  int derived_id;

  Derived(int new_base, int new_derived)
    : Base(new_base), derived_id(new_derived) {}

  void show() {
    std::cout << base_id << " " << derived_id;
  }
};

int main() {
  Derived temp(1, 2);
  
  temp.show(); // Outputs: 1 2

  return 0;
}
```
## Polymorphism

In C++, polymorphism occurs when a derived class overrides a method inherited from its base class with the same function signature.

Polymorphism gives a method many ???forms???. Which form is executed depends on the type of the caller object.
```
#include <iostream>

class Employee {
public:
  void salary() {
    std::cout << "Normal salary.\n";
  }
};

class Manager: public Employee {
public:
  void salary() {
    std::cout << "Normal salary and bonus.\n";
  }
};

int main() {
  Employee newbie;
  Manager boss;
  
  newbie.salary(); // Outputs: Normal salary.
  boss.salary(); // Outputs: Normal salary and bonus.
  
  return 0;
}
```
## Class Members

A class is comprised of class members:

   * Attributes, also known as member data, consist of information about an instance of the class.
   * Methods, also known as member functions, are functions that can be used with an instance of the class.
```
class City {

  // Attribute
  int population;

public:
  // Method
  void add_resident() {
    population++;
  }

};
```
## Constructor

For a C++ class, a constructor is a special kind of method that enables control regarding how the objects of a class should be created. Different class constructors can be specified for the same class, but each constructor signature must be unique.
```
#include "city.hpp"

class City {

  std::string name;
  int population;

public:
  City(std::string new_name, int new_pop);

};
```
## Objects

In C++, an object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and functionality pertaining to that data.
```
City nyc;
```
## Class

A C++ class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates information and behavior about an object. It serves as a blueprint for future inherited classes.
```
class Person {

};
```
## Access Control Operators

C++ classes have access control operators that designate the scope of class members:

   * public
   * private

public members are accessible everywhere; private members can only be accessed from within the same instance of the class or from friends classes.
```
class City {

  int population; 

public:
  void add_resident() { 
    population++;
  }

private:
  bool is_capital;

};
```
